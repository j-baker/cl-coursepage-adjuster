cl-coursepages
==============

A Chrome extension to adjust pages on the University of Cambridge
CL Course Pages.

On small screens, it's mildly irritating in the Lent and Easter
terms to scroll down through the Michaelmas courses that you
no longer care about. This extension copies the current term's
courses so that they appear at the top of the list.

Pull requests appreciated.
