cl-coursepages
==============

A Chrome extension to adjust pages on the University of Cambridge
CL Course Pages.

On small screens, it's mildly irritating in the Lent and Easter
terms to scroll down through the Michaelmas courses that you
no longer care about. This extension copies the current term's
courses so that they appear at the top of the list.

I shan't be publishing this to the Chrome store, but using this
extension is trivial - merely clone the repository, navigate to

    chrome://extensions

enable Developer mode, and open the folder as an extension.

Pull requests appreciated.
